## Overview
This repository contains programs related to the **Advanced Java Programming** module for the **sixth semester of the BCA program at Tribhuvan University (TU)**. It serves as a resource for students to enhance their understanding of advanced Java concepts through hands-on coding.

## Repository Contents
- **Examples and Exercises:** A collection of programs aligned with the Advanced Java Programming syllabus.
- **Class and Method Flow Documentation:** The `Class And Method Flow.txt` file provides insights into the structure and logic of the implemented programs.
- **Project Management System:** A full-fledged project demonstrating practical implementation of Java concepts.

## Project: Project Management System
This repository includes a **Project Management System**, designed using:
- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture
- **DAO (Data Access Object)** pattern for efficient database interactions
- **Singleton Design Pattern** for controlled instance creation
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)** for database operations

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following external libraries:
- **MySQL Connector JAR:** Required for connecting Java applications to a MySQL database.
- **FlatLaf JAR:** A modern look-and-feel library for Java Swing applications.

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have **Java 8 or later** installed.
2. Install **MySQL Server** and create the necessary database schema.
3. Add the **MySQL Connector JAR** and **FlatLaf JAR** to your project's classpath.
4. Compile and run the project using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
